# Thanksgiving Dinner

## A React Suspense and lazy() demo

### Walkthrough

#### 1. initial commit

At this stage, we're loading images on the client-side without handling loading states. The only webpack chunks in the network tab of Chrome DevTools are the ones that come by default with create-react-app. The experience is jumpy and slow for the user.

#### 2. add some loading spinners

We haven't done anything to lazyload yet...
